<p>For all you people that are here to sign the Guestbook again, I'd like to make it quite clear that it is now FIXED! And I am extremely sorry that it wasn't working for so long, and that so many entries were lost. Please feel free to sign the guestbook, and try to make this entry as good as your original! Also, two new entries added to the library today ('Dead Famous' and 'The Master of Rain').</p>
