<p>After running on an increasingly crusty install of Drupal 4.7 for the past 8 years or so, Jaza's World has just been converted to a custom lightweight PHP system, with no database and with all content living in plain ol' files. I migrated <a href="http://worldtrip.greenash.net.au/">Jaza's World Trip</a> over to this system last year (also from Drupal 4.7), and blogged about <a href="http://greenash.net.au/thoughts/2014/05/database-free-content-tagging-with-files-and-glob/">some of the geekier details</a> on GreenAsh. In a nutshell: the new system is perfect for a site like Jaza's World, which is basically (long since) retired / archived, and which should ideally run with minimal dev requirements, and use up minimal server resources. So, enjoy the same old Jaza's World, preserved in all its bizarre hippo-trumpeting glory for a whole lot longer.</p>
