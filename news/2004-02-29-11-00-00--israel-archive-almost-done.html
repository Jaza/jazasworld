<p>Over the past week, I've been working extremely hard to get as much of the Israel trip stuff finished as possible. You'll be pleased to know that every single Israel photo in the gallery now has a description, which you can see by hovering the mouse over the thumbnails (all other photos still have none). My mammoth project, the Israel diary, is now half completed: you can find the first 21 out of 42 entries in the library, and the other half are on their way ASAP. Once again, my apologies: I hoped to have everything done before Uni (which starts tomorrow), but typing up this diary is just taking forever!</p>
