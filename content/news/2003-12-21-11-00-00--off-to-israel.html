<p>School is far behind, the HSC is over, results have come out, and I'm off to Israel tomorrow. Life is GOOD! But seeing as I'll be away for so long, and as I haven't made any updates for (exactly) 2 months, I thought I'd give everyone some light holiday reading. The library now has more than just book reviews: it also has a number of stories written by me! In particular, due to several requests, my Extension 2 English major work 'Running Rings' is now online in full (i.e. the story and the reflection statement - but not the journal). You will also find the popular story 'Traffic Light', as seen in the 2003 edition of the Killara High 'Green Years' magazine, and much much more. Merry Christmas, Happy Chanukah, Happy New Year... and Happy Holidays!</p>
