<p>After running on "a custom lightweight PHP system" for the past 6 years or so, Jaza's World has just been rebuilt in <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, a static site generator (SSG). This has allowed me to move Jaza's World to be hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, instead of on my ol' VPS. I recently did a similar migration of <a href="https://worldtrip.greenash.net.au/">Jaza's World Trip</a> to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, another SSG. Expect a tech write-up of the Eleventy experience on <a href="https://greenash.net.au/">GreenAsh</a> soon. Anyway, sorry to disappoint those of you who are awaiting the overdue demise of "that lame prehistoric blight upon cyberspace" known as Jaza's World. <a href="https://sacred-texts.com/neu/mphg/mphg.htm">Not dead yet!</a></p>
