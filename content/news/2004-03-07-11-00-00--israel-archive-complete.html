<p>I am very proud to announce that the Israel diary is completely finished, and is now online in the library! Fellow Academy-2-ites, friends and family, enjoy my epic account of our 42-day tour of Israel, complete with photos (borrowed from the gallery), and a table of contents that also serves as a summary and an itinerary reference. This is the biggest thing ever to hit Jaza's World, so don't miss out on seeing it: because it will only be here for a very unlimited time!</p>
