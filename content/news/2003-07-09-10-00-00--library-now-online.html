<p>After a day of rather extensive review-writing, the Library is now updated and online! There are currently 16 books listed in the library, both on the front page and in the archives. All are dated, and come complete with lengthy descriptions. Also, every single book has a photo of the cover next to it. None of my work is online, as yet, but stay tuned! You never know, I might decide to put some on soon.</p>
