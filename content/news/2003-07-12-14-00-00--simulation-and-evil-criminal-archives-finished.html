<p>Simulation and Evil / Criminal archives now finished in the 'interests' section. I've decided to scrap Racing, have never really been a fan of racing games anyway. So as of now, the 'interests' section is complete. And guess what? The 'interests' section was the last one I had to finish! So, I am proud to announce, the new 2003 edition of <strong>Jaza's World is now finished and ready!</strong> Yay! Now let's go party...</p>
