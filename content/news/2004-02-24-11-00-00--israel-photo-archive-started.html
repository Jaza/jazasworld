<p>I've been back in Australia for 3 weeks now, and as of today my photos from Israel are online and ready to view in the gallery! As well as almost 200 photos and thumbnails, there's also a fun little animation for you all. I know some of you are waiting for me to publish an online diary (extracts from my Israel diary, along with some photos), and my apologies that this is not ready yet. It is on the cards, and it will be finished in the near future. Also, good luck and all the best to everyone starting Uni, TAFE, apprenticeships or work this year!</p>
