<p>I like all the photos of Boo. And the photos of me are much better than the ones you had in your other page - I look much thinnner. But then I am 19 kilos thinner!!! But you need to spend more time doing your homework and less time playing those horrible violent games and you could also take Boo for more walks instead of being on the computer so much. He needs the exercise!!!!!!</p>
