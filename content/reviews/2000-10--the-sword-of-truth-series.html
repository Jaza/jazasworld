<p>One of the more recent - and certainly one of the best - epic fantasies to take the world by storm. This is very much the classic fantasy, set in a medieval world of wizards and warriors, much like the worlds of Tolkien or of Jordan. The hero, Richard Cypher, is a country bumpkin who discovers he has a million different royal heritages, and who (surprise, surprise!) is the product of several various prophecies. As with the WoT, the SoT series features a great deal of magic, enormous armies, great kingdoms, and some very classic romances. I compare it a great deal with other fantasy series, but I shouldn't do this, because SoT also has a lot to offer in its own right. It has a depth of characterisation, and a wonderful plot, that sets it apart from any of the other fantasy series. So far, there are six books in the series: <em>Wizard's First Rule</em>; <em>The Stone of Tears</em>; <em>Blood of the Fold</em>; <em>Temple of the Winds</em>; <em>Soul of the Fire</em>; and the latest one, my personal favourite, <em>Faith of the Fallen</em>. This series is essential reading for any serious fan of the fantasy genre!</p>
