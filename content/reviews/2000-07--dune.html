<p><em>Dune</em> is the first in a series of six, considered to be one of the best works of science fiction ever created. Set on the desert world of Dune, House Atreides and House Harkonnen battle each other for control of the precious spice, the expensive drug that the entire galaxy wishes to buy, and that are linked to the mysterious and deadly giant worms that inhabit the planet. As with all great sci-fi, <em>Dune</em> is filled with all manner of gadgets, with incredible interstellar vehicles, and with Jedi-like mind control beings. Very much a traditional family feud, good vs evil type story, with the young Paul Atreides being the great hero of his house. One of the sci-fi classics, and definitely worth everyone's reading.</p>
