<p>This is, in every sense of the phrase, the best of the best. It's the best book by Tom Clancy, who is himself the best of all military action novelists. Rainbow is a new international anti-terrorism unit, headed by former CIA heavy John Clark, and comprised of the top men from elite forces the world over. We see the weapons, the tactics and the trademarks of such units as the US Navy SEALs, the British SAS, the French and German elite units, as well as the Israeli Mossad. The novel opens with an attempted aircraft hijacking (it was written before 9/11), and finishes with a chilling attempt to unleash a biological plague upon the world at Sydney's 2000 Olympic Games (written before them, too). Rainbow Six features Clancy's usual political intrigues, diplomatic bungles, and of course his top-standard action scenes. I've also read <em>The Hunt for Red October</em> and <em>The Cardinal of the Kremlim</em>, and although I also recommend these two, they don't even come close to the great plot, great action and great twists of the legendary <em>Rainbow Six</em>.</p>
