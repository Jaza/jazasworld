<p>The first, and by far the greatest, epic fantasy every written. Voted best book of the 20th century, although in my opinion it's the best piece of literature in all history! The three books in the LOTR trilogy are: <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, <em>The Two Towers</em>, and <em>The Return of the King</em>. As the blurb says: "The English-speaking world is divided into those who have read <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and <em>The Hobbit</em> and those who are going to read them." If you've read the books, you'll know what I'm talking about. If you haven't read them yet, then for G-d's sake READ THEM! LOTR is the classic story of the mythical battle betweeen good and evil, of heroes and villains, and of a very small Hobbit who has to carry a very small ring a very long way. Also now a major new trilogy of films. At the time of writing, the third movie is not out for another six months. Also, once you've read the LOTR trilogy and The Hobbit, do not despair, for you've only scraped the surface of Tolkien's mythical universe! You can go on to read <em>The Silmarillion</em>, an epic story of the First Age of Middle-Earth, as well as <em>Unfinished Tales</em>. And if that's not enough, try reading all 12 volumes of <em>The History Of Middle-Earth</em>, published posthumously by J.R.R.'s son, Christopher Tolkien.</p>
