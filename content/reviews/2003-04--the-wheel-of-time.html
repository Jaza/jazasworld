<p>Second only to LOTR, this is the must-read fantasy series for absolutely anyone and everyone! At the time of writing (2003), there are 10 books in the WoT series: <em>The Eye of the World</em> (cover on left), <em>The Great Hunt</em>, <em>The Dragon Reborn</em>, <em>The Shadow Rising</em>, <em>The Fires of Heaven</em>, <em>Lord of Chaos</em>, <em>A Crown of Swords</em>, <em>The Path of Daggers</em>, <em>Winter's Heart</em>, and the latest (published this year) <em>Crossroads of Twilight</em>. The WoT chronicles the epic battle between the forces of light and dark, in a fantasy world described in phenomenal detail. The Dragon Reborn, a farmboy named Rand Al'Thor - along with friends, warriors, sorcerers and numerous lovers - must defeat the Dark One, his dreaded Forsaken, and the multitude of evil Shadowspawn that threaten to darken the world forever. This is a series filled with magic, phophecy, epic battles, kings and queens, romance, and above all grandeur. You'll be hard pressed finding a longer or a more descriptive series of books: Jordan makes Tolstoy look like a short-story writer.</p>
