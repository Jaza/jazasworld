<p>A truly magnificent fantasy series chronicling the life and adventures of Sparrowhawk - a shepherd boy who becomes the greatest of all wizards - in a unique world of archipelago (small island) kingdoms. The four books in the series are: <em>A Wizard of Earthsea</em>, <em>The Tombs of Atuan</em>, <em>The Farthest Shore</em>, and <em>Tehanu</em>. A fifth book has just been published this year (2003), but at the time of writing I have not read it. This is a fantasy world filled with magic, fierce warriors of all creeds and races, fearsome creatures such as minotaurs and dragons, as well as a particularly high level of heroics. A must-read for all lovers of heroic adventures to every corner of the globe, as well as all fans of the good ol' classic fantasy.</p>
