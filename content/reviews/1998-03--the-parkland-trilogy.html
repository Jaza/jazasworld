<p><em>Parkland</em>, <em>Earthsong</em> and <em>Fire Dancer</em> are three remarkable books that provide three different visions of our world at some point in the distant future (although <em>Fire Dancer</em> is set primarily in our distant past). All these books take a fearlessly close look at human nature, examining our inherent weaknesses and how they will eventually - and inevitably - be our downfall. Parkland is set in a world where humans are savage animals, caged within giant zoos that are fenced off from the outside world. Earthsong is set in a post-environmental holocaust future, where humans once lived at the bottom of the sea, but now survive only on distant planets. Fire Dancer is about two people from the future, who travel back in time to the Neanderthal era, and who manage to ultimately become part of this ancient community, learning their primitive language and gradually appreciating the beauty of their simple traditions. All three books are masterpieces of the science fiction genre, as well as great all-round pieces of literature.</p>
