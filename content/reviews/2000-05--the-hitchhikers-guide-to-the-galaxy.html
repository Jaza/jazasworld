<p>If you're interested in manic-depressed robots, want to know how to distract a bomb so it doesn't blow up, and are desperately seeking the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything, then this is the book for you! <em>Hitchhiker's guide</em> (a trilogy in four parts) is possibly the strangest piece of literature ever written. In the tradition of such greats in surrealism as Monty Python and the Goons, it is most definitely the best of British humour. <em>Hitchhiker's guide</em> is also the blueprint of the sci-fi parody genre, with such spawns as Red Dwarf being inspired from it. The four books in this 'trilogy' are: <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>; <em>The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</em>; <em>Life, the Universe, and Everything</em>; and <em>So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish</em>. There is also a fifth book, <em>Mostly Harmless</em>, as well as countless other works written to supplement it. After you've read these books, even the strangest and freakiest events of real life will seem dull and boring.</p>
