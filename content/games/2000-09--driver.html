<p>Driver's a 3D game where you drive around various cities, performing jobs for the organised crime boys, usually getaways or tailings. It is extremely fun, particularly the 'undercover' levels, where you work your way up to harder and harder jobs. You can drive around as fast or as recklessly as you like in traffic, you can bash into other cars, and you can perform insane stunts. But whatever you do, don't get the cops on your tail! The graphics are quite good in this game, particularly considering how old the game is. The sound is also quite good, with realistic acceleration and braking noises. All-up, a challenging, exciting and very fun game.</p>
