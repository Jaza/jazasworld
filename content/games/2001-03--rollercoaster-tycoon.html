<p>There are quite a few games where you can build your own theme park, but Rollercoaster Tycoon is by far the best! There are a number of different settings in which you can build your parks, from deserts to lakesides to the blustery Antarctic. And, as with a real theme park, the best thing about this game is the rides! You can put in gentle merry-go-rounds, monorails and steam trains, scary rollercoasters and pirate ships, as well as refreshment shops such as burger bars, and even toilets. Plan, design, build and manage everything in your park. Set the cost of entry and of the rides. Hire staff to take care of the grounds and fix up broken amusements. Manage your budget and take out loans. Invest money in researching new attractions. The possibilities are endless, and it's all up to you! Have fun.</p>
