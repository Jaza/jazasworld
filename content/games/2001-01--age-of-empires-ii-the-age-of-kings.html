<p>The leading strategy game in terms of medieval warfare. I highly recommend this game for its graphics, its gameplay and its depth. Of particular quality, and of greatest importance in any strategy game, are the campaigns. There are five in AOE2: William Wallace, Joan of Arc, Saladin, Genghis Khan, and Barbarosa. You can play any one of about 20 different civilisations as well. Each one has their own unique units and attributes. One feature of this game unique among RTS, is that it comes with a 'history' section providing detailed information about each of the civilisations featured. Excellent reading for all those who are interested, quite a lot there but written in a fairly light style. Also, the usual custom scenarios, scenario editors, and multiplayer features. One of the most fun ways to play this game is by using 'Regicide', where you have to kill the other players' kings. All up, AOE2 is an excellent strategy game that can keep you occupied for many, many hours.</p>
