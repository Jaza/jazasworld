<p>Enthralling RTS set in a pseudo-present world where the Cold War never seems to have ended. Play as either Allies or Soviets, build up your armies, and pit everything - naval power, air forces, even nukes - against each other. Extremely fast-paced, excellent on multiplayer mode. Two very well-produced campaigns, as well as a good range of units, buildings, etc. Graphics and sound are very good, and gameplay is phenomenal. Yet another extremely addictive title, so don't start playing it unless you have plenty of hours to spare. Good luck, comrade!</p>
