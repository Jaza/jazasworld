<p>Warcraft is one of my personal favourites as far as strategy goes. In Warcraft II, you could only play as either Orcs or Humans. Now, there are Orcs, Humans, Undead and Night Elves. The original RTS game has also been turned slightly RPG-ish with the addition of heroes, powerful units able to cast spells and fight extremely well in combat, as well as gain levels from experience, and rise again from the dead. There are four campaigns in Warcraft III, and all of them are terrific fun. The best thing about this game, of course, are the strange little things you can do with your men! Click on the sheep too many times and they explode. Click on your units enough, and they'll start saying things like: "Why don't you lead an army instead of touching me?", or "Me not that kind of Orc!", and then "Ooh, that was kind of nice". Hours of fun can be spent leading armies, or, well, clicking on armies. Whichever one turns you on, Warcraft III is a sensational and long-awaited addition to the RTS genre!</p>
