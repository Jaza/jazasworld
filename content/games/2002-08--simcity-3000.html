<p>Simcity is the ABSOLUTE BEST computer game EVER made. There is no game in this world that can even come close to beating it. The first time I played Simcity 2000, I was hooked. Now, with Simcity 3000, it's gotten even better. As the slogan suggests, you really can 'create and control your own urban empire'! Everything from roads, to schools, to zoning, to sewerage... it's all up to you! Simcity has rewards for making a large or beautiful city. You can wreak havoc upon your citizens by making natural disasters. You can trade with your neighbouring cities and build transport links to them. You can do ANYTHING. If you've always wanted to build your own city, or you've always wanted to unleash disasters on innocent civilians, then this is the game for you! I haven't played the all new Simcity 4 yet, but I hear it's even better than 3000! These are, I say again, THE BEST games ever made. The most classic games of all time!</p>
