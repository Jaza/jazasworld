<p>A truly engaging game that lets you build an enormous transport network spanning an entire continent. The aim of this game is simple: to transport goods from wherever they're produced, to wherever they're needed, and hence to make lots of money. You can also transport people from one town to another. This game's a bit like SimCity, except you only build the transport, and you play the role of the Company Manager, not the City Mayor. You can spend literally weeks building railway networks, chartering flights, sending ships to remote oil platforms, and so on. As time goes on, new transport is made available and you can upgrade from Trains to Monorails. This game is endless - you just keep building, and building, and building. A very challenging, very fun, and very unique kind of simulation game.</p>
