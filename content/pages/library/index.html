  <h2>My writings</h2>

  <p>This new addition to the Jaza's World library has been in the pipeline for some time now, and is finally here for your viewing. Most of the writings here are stories done during my school life.</p>

  <div id="library-warning"><p><strong>WARNING:</strong> All material in this section of the library copyright Jeremy Epstein, according to dates given for each work. In particular, the story 'Running Rings' is an official HSC major work, and any future HSC students planning to plagiarise this work from Jaza's World (or anywhere else) WILL be caught and WILL face severe consequences from the NSW Board of Studies (and from me!).</p>

  <p>I like to make it well known that I am an advocate of freedom of information, and of free and unrestricted access to intellectual property. This is why I have put my work online for you to LOOK at. I have no objection to you being inspired by the material here, or to it being used explicitly IF it is properly referenced and I am acknowledged as the original author. However, I also like to make it clear that I believe the word 'appropriation' can often be synonymous with the word 'theft', and I will not tolerate anyone calling their work 'appropriated', if they have twisted the definition of this word to include 'plagiarism'.</p></div>

  <h2>Books</h2>

  <p><strong>A note on ratings:</strong> in the last edition of Jaza's World, I provided a rating out of ten for each book. Seeing that all the books on this page are fantastic, I feel it is pointless giving perfect ratings to every book that I list. So just bear in mind that every book on this page is worthy of 10/10, except for those in the 'best of all time' section, which deserve at least 11/10.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> 'The Wheel of Time' series, and 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' (a trilogy in four parts), are both in the sci-fi / fantasy archives. However, these two are also good enough to be right here on the front page.</p>
