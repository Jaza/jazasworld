  <h2>Computer games</h2>

  <p>This section existed on the previous edition of Jaza's World, in name only. Now it actually has content on it. In much the same way as the <a href="/library/">library</a> has book reviews, so too does this section have game reviews. Also, as with the book reviews, I haven't bothered to put ratings down, since all the games here are worthy of at least 10/10.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Grand Theft Auto II</em>, and <em>Thief 2: The Metal Age</em>, are both in the <a href="/interests/games/categories/evil-criminal/">Evil / Criminal archives</a> where they belong. However, these games are two of my personal favourites of all time, and so please bear in mind that although they're hidden away in the archives, they are good enough to be right here on the front page.</p>
