  This was my major work project for HSC English Extension 2. It deals with the difficulty of leaving the past behind, as well as with issues of conformity, lack of individualism, and the nature of fate and destiny. These themes are expressed through the life story of the central character, and his ongoing struggle to find acceptance within society by trying to discard his own personality. Just three days ago (18th Dec), I received my HSC results, and found that 'Running Rings' had scored a mark of 48/50! Now that the 2003 HSC is over, I am reasonably confident that I am not breaking any Board of Studies rules by putting this story online for public viewing.
