<p>Our first stop today was the oldest Kibbutz in the Golan, where we had a big discussion with a couple living there (Dror and Ronnie) about the political situation in the Golan. Ronnie was a moderate, saying she was prepared to give up her home for peace; but Dror was as hard-right as they come, saying: "let the Australians give their country back to the Aborigines; the Americans give it back to the Indians, etc; then maybe I'll give up my land".</p>

The fact that Syria has already been offered the Golan twice, and has refused it, does not help the situation.</p>

[We hiked through the park] We stopped at a vulture lookout on the way back, and saw a few vultures wheeling in the sky. Nim explained why their numbers have declined, and how feeding stations and the preservation of their nesting cliffs has helped to reverse this situation.</p>

Then it was back on the bus: I slept again on our return journey. We went to the Naot shoe factory, where we shopped around and had a look at shoes.</p>

We went all the way up the ridge overlooking the Hula Valley, and took some photos at the top. I got a photo with a really funny sign of a person falling off a cliff.</p>
