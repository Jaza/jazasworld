  Desert Survival: <em>'it was the tree that walked into me!' (Michal), long hikes, massive mountains, 'snow white' (Jess), trench round the tents, Toto, shit in the sand</em>
---
<p>I slept like a baby last night: about 10 hours straight; didn't get up til about 8am. The trench around the tents may have helped a bit, but not much: when I woke up, my jeans were soaking wet. Before we left for the hike this morning, we played a game of hide 'n' seek, where we all had to run to a rock without getting tipped, and it was heaps of fun.</p>

We climbed some unbearably steep slopes, and scaled some mountains that absolutely buggered us. However, the views were incredible; and doing this kind of stuff gives you a real sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>We stopped to have lunch by some cliff steps, and everyone chucked rocks at each other. I fashioned an ergonomic rock, with smoothed edges on the sides that you hold.</p>

We had some beautiful tomato soup, and tea, and set up a fire. When it got dark, many people got out a Nagila and started smoking it. This Nagila stuff is really popular in Israel.</p>
<p>Dinner last night was a rich stew with fatty beef, and bits of chicken and vegies. After dinner, I made my first shit in the outdoors in my entire life. I sat on a rock, and I covered it up with sand afterwards. I had to burn the toilet paper with a cigarette lighter.</p>
