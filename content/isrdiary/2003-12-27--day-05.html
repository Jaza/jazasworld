  Jerusalem: <em>Yom Shabbat, Havdallah, Neil Lazrus (short Pommy) seminar</em>
---
<p>Nice relaxing day, as Shabbos should be. We spent most of the morning in our room, then had a big Shabbos lunch and a kiddush. After lunch, a few of us guys went to the pool for a swim. [Down at the pool,] I met this Israeli guy that I talked to for ages. He was mainly talking about the violence, and about how important it is for Jews to live in Israel.</p>
<p>I read this <em>really</em> disgusting story in an FHM, [but the description of that story has been omitted from this edited version of my diary... however, those who have read it will remember it, no doubt... any man cringes just at the memory of it].</p>
<p>We had a nice little Havdalah service; and after dinner this fat British guy (that's how he said we'd remember him, and he's right!) called Lazarus gave a really good talk on the situation in the Middle East. He was really funnny: he insulted Marissa's shoes; and he pointed out on a map that "what we can see here is <em>clearly</em> the stain from my coffee cup".</p>
<p>He was very informative, focusing on the regional situation and very recent developments. I asked him if the wall is a long-term solution, and he said "no", but also made it very clear that it's working really well at stemming the tide of suicide bombers at present.</p>
<p>At 11pm, we had a very moving activity to prepare us for Yad Vashem. We each had a candle, and the story of a victim of the holocaust to read out.</p>
