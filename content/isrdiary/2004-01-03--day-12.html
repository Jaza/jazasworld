<p>BIRTHDAY ENTRY!!!</p>
<p>I had a wonderful sleep, staying in bed until 11am. I was up and ready in time for lunch at 12pm. As soon as I walked out my door, people continuously wished me 'happy birthday'; and during the day people must have sung it at least 10 times. It was quite surreal: suddenly my birthday had become such a big deal!</p>
<p>When I went to lunch, the entire Academy sang 'Happy B'day', after Dave announced it. Lunch was beautiful, but the constant focus on my birthday was just mind-boggling. After lunch, I had a little schloof / siesta, then Nim took us on a tour of Tsfat. It was bloody cold, and I didn't take warm enough gear at all. The city was almost empty, since it's such a religious place and it was Shabbos.</p>
<p>Nim told a cool story about a guy who gave bread to Hashem every week, and another who took it from 'Hashem' every week: very cute story, but a rather sad ending.</p>
<p>We got back from the tour, and after a little break, went to a Seudat Shlishi with the Hareidim. It was great singing and eating, but we couldn't stay for long, because we had to go do Havdalah. We went downstairs; and everyone sang 'Happy B'day' <em>again</em> (in English and Ivrit); we also all ate Crembo (for which Dave is now so famous); and made a million Lechayims.</p>
<p>It was very sad when we did Havdalah, because Shabbat in Tsfat - my first proper Shabbat in years, and one of my holiest ever - had come to an end. Soon after Havdalah, we got ready to go, and then went on the bus, bound for the Hot Springs near the Golan Heights.</p>
<p>It took about an hour to get to the Hot Springs. Once we were in, the place was packed with Aussies, since <em>all</em> of Academy and Achshav were there. The pool is amazing: there's Sulfur in the water, and it makes the whole pool naturally heated to app 42C.</p>
<p>I swam in this beautiful pool for 1 1/2 hours, and it was extremely relaxing and soothing. It also made me feel better [had been a bit sick today].</p>
