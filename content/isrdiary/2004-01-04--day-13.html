Crossing the Jordan into the Golan is a scary feeling: although it's officially (if debatably) Israeli, you can't help but feel you're in enemy land. The fact that it has more landmines than anywhere else in the world <em>doesn't</em> help.</p>

From it, you can see the spectacular countryside to the north and west (Israeli) and east (Syrian) of the volcanic mountain ridge. Across the valley to the north is Mt Hermon, the highest mountain in "Israel" (2224m ASL - 4m less than Kusciuszko!): We control 7% of it, and have a "secret" base at the very top.</p>

I asked for hot chocolate, but they gave me really strong coffee instead, and I didn't realise 'til we left: really pissed me off!</p>

The hike was impressive, but long, rocky, and extremely tiring. We saw an enormously deep waterfall that fell into a pool far below us; and there were animals that made really weird noises (apart from us, that is).</p>

<p>Towards the end, we had to slip under a fence into a huge, rocky field. We were sure that Nim was leading us into a minefield; but somehow, we got out of there alive.</p>
<p>We had lunch at a kiosk area; and after lunch, went to a winery for the Golan vineyards experience. The tourguide at the winery was <em>so</em> funny! He had a big beard; a half-french accent; he kept tapping and circling areas of his map with a wand; and his whole presentation was practised to include hand movements and noises!</p>
<p>We saw a dodgy video on the Golan; saw the storage and bottling rooms (machines were shut down for the night already); and then did the important stuff: wine tasting.</p>
<p><span class="inline left"><a href="/gallery/trip-to-israel-2003-2004/golan-heights-manara-maccabia-bridge-hebrew-uni/israel-shot-079/"><img src="{{ params.uploadsBaseURL }}photos/IMG0037.embedded.jpg" alt="Lechayim upon Har Bental" title="Lechayim upon Har Bental" class="image embedded" width="97" height="145" /></a><span class="caption" style="width: 95px;">Lechayim upon Har Bental</span></span>The Irish lady gave us 3 sloshes of wine - white, red, then white again - and explained how to be a real connoisseur and slosh it round in your mouth. I downed all 3 with a few pretzels: I had a stomach ache after. I also bought a 91 NIS bottle of '95 Sauvignon, as a present for Poppy.</p>
<p>By the time we were done at the winery, the day was dark. We went to our lodgings for the night - a kibbutz by the Galil - had dinner, and also got ready for tonight's mega cruise on the Galil with all of Academy and Achshav. The cruise was a big disco with plenty of dancing: it was OK; I danced with the rest of Academy 2 most of the time.</p>
