When we got there, our first stop was the thick, fortified walls of the old city. Under the clear blue sky, we took heaps of photos by a line of cannons put by the walla in Napoleon's time, by the Ottoman defenders (who succeeded in repelling Napoleon - with the help of the British).</p>

Plenty of phallic symbolism there!</p>
<p>Having finished our photos shots, we then went on a long, boring tour of the Crusader ruins. The tour took most of the morning: we saw the halls of the Hospitallers; the waterways of the Templars; and heaps of stuff that they're still excavating. There was also the British prison complex, where many Jewish guerrilla fighters were held; and where the famous Akko breakout occurred.</p>
<p>The tour ended by the ruined Crusader fort on the sea. We had some free time, where we could buy souvenirs from some nearby shops. I bought two little Chassidic blokes, for 100 sheks all up.</p>
<p>We walked along the sea-wall of old Akko, from where we had a view of the bay that stretched all the way down to the Haifa peninsula. When the wall ended, we went through the city itself, dodging a terrible mess of traffic - the road are shocking in Akko, and the drivers are even worse - in order to get to our bus.</p>
<p>The bus had our lunches in it, so we took the packs and ate lunch in a nearby park. For some reason, Ari decided to peg tomatoes at Dane while he was on his mobile: so whilst he was talking, Dane got a torrent of tomatoes raining down around him.</p>
<p>After lunch, it was time to go back into Akko. We went to visit the Turkish baths: this was the most fun thing we did in Akko. We went on a tour through the Ottoman bathhouse, and on the way listened to this funny Arab guy talking about how life worked in this place. There was also a funny video to go with it, of these fat old men getting stuff rubbed over their bodies, and listening to local gossip. A bit grotty, but funny nonetheless.</p>
<p>That was the end of our tour in Akko. After that, we took a visit to the Baha'i gardens, where we saw the house and the burial spot of the Baha'ullah, the founder of the Baha'i faith. The gardens were very beautiful.</p>
<p>Nimrod gave us the rundown on the Baha'i faith. We took a fair few photos at the gardens, but not as many as I thought we would.</p>

It was a pretty cool place: we caught a cable car down the mountain; and we actually saw the very place where the Israel-Lebanon border is. I, and pretty much everyone else, took a photo of the "military area: no photography" sign. After all, they were just asking for it!</p>
<p><span class="inline right"><a href="/gallery/trip-to-israel-2003-2004/akko-rosh-hanikra-haifa-ramat-hadassa/israel-shot-129/"><img src="{{ params.uploadsBaseURL }}photos/IMG0135.embedded.jpg" alt="At Rosh Hanikra" title="At Rosh Hanikra" class="image embedded" width="145" height="97" /></a><span class="caption" style="width: 143px;">At Rosh Hanikra</span></span>Rosh Hanikra is full of these sea-caves called 'grottos', where the seawater comes right in and forms big rivers inside the caves. We explored the grottos; and we also saw a movie about how the British built a train track  through Rosh Hanikra during WWII. However, the track (it went from Cairo to Istanbul) wasn't used after Israel was established, for obvious reasons.</p>

But we still got plenty of photos.</p>
<p>So we left Rosh Hanikra as the sun set, and returned to our hotel in Nahariya. After dinner, we did a little "happy birthday" celebration for Tanya, since it's her "****ing birthday". As a joke, the Madrichim gave her chocolate cigarettes as a present.</p>
<p>Our night activity was a trip to a pub around the corner. I spent most of the night either watching or playing pool: that's all anyone was doing, since there were about 10 pool tables. I was surprised to learn that I'm actually not that bad at pool. I drank some vodka and mango, which tasted really nice.</p>
