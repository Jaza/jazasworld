<p>Not much to say about the majority of today, because I spent it in bed in my hotel room! That's right: I decided that if I am to get rid of this damn flu, I must take the day off.</p>
<p>So while everyone else went to the Knesset and the Supreme Court (which were apparently both very boring) in the cold and the wet, I had a pleasant rest back at Kibbutz Tsuba.</p>
<p>I felt rested enough by the afternoon to go with the group to the Taglit Mega Event that was on tonight. This was a pretty cool show, with heaps of live music (a band called "Gaya"), and an annoying Yankee host. Us Aussies also pissed off the Yanks by singing and chanting all night.</p>
<p>We met a girl from Jersey at the food hall - Rachel - and Yoni pissed her off by telling heaps of lies about Australia. She was pretty nice, and not as gullible as most Americans.</p>
