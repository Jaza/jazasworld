Before breakfast, I saw the sun rise over the Dead Sea, and it was an absolutely spectacular sight.</p>

Michal fell on the rocks, and in our first medical incident of the trip, hurt herself and was bleeding badly. Fortunately, Einat was nearby and patched her up nice 'n' quick.</p>
<p>The hike continued for about 3 hours, winding along the side of forbidding gorges, mesas and cliff faces, going up and down and round about. Along the way, we stopped at some ancient ruins where it is believed that King David once hid in a cave from King Saul.</p>

We continued to the Wadi of David, and along the way met many Americans and Pommies. The Yanks fell for my accent, actually thought I was American: I've never tested it before, but it worked!</p>

Most people were too chicken, but myself and some others stripped down to our swimmers and went for a swim. The water was a bit cold, but delightfully refreshing. I was very surprised that we went in the cold water, and the Pommies didn't.</p>

We met a group of 16-year-old Israeli girls, and talked about movies and music.</p>
<p>We left En Gedi, and caught the bus to the Bedouin area. About halfway there, we stopped the bus while Burnett stopped to take a piss. You could see the urine blowing in the wind - charming.</p>

Asher and myself shared a camel. It was nice riding through the desert, but I got a sore ass, and my balls were squashed into pancakes. On the way back, Daniel and Beck's camel was sick, so they had to walk back.</p>

We played a few silly games to pass the time, then went into the eating tent for dinner.</p>
<p>The Bedouin meal was so cool! First we had really sweet, yummy tea; then really disgusting, bitter coffee; and finally, a big meal of pita with lamb, rice and salad stuffing. We ate it all on the floor, and all made a terrible mess. I got it all over myself.</p>
<p>After dinner, Beck told the funniest joke I've ever heard - the "Oogalaboogala" joke. The ending [which I've edited out, so as to not spoil the joke] was so [something], I just couldn't stop laughing.</p>
<p>We started a campfire, and for a while we roasted marshmallows, sang heaps of silly songs (e.g. 'Rock Around the Clock', 'Tell me More' from Grease, and of course 'Hinei Matov'). All of that under the starlit desert sky. It was a bit smoky, but as with every campfire I've ever been at, the atmosphere was nothing short of heavenly. Also, we drank heaps of yummy Bedouin tea.</p>

I'm surrounded by people talking, massaging and playing games. We have a 3am start tomorrow morning, because we're hiking up Masada for a view of the sunrise. The Bedouin experience has been amazing so far. The Bedouin guy was really funny when he said: "We can have up to 4 wives, but one is more than enough for me".</p>
