<p>[First stop this morning was Ammunition Hill.] This is a really special place, because it's where the most difficult (and most important) battle of the Six Day War was won by Israel. We saw all the trenches that the Jordanians dug, in order to fortify the place. We also saw a movie about the battle.</p>
<p>It was extremely cold and windy on the hill, and none of us coped very well with it: almost everyone is sick to some extent!</p>

Our next stop was Hebrew University, where we went on a tour with this Canadian girl who made Aliyah just one year ago. She showed us all around the place, and we went to a really nice shule with a view of the Kotel and the old city. The tour wasn't that interesting: but at least it was warm inside!</p>
<p>On the way back from the uni, we stopped at a pharmacy, and I bought Panadol, Robitussin, and Strepsils: I don't like taking drugs to get better, but I really need some help right now.</p>
<p>After dinner, a South African guy gave us a talk about love, marriage and relationships. He gave a drosheh that to really love someone, you have to give a part of yourself towards them.</p>
