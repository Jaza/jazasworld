  Jerusalem: <em>weekend with family (very sick)</em>
---
<p>I didn't get up until 10:30 this morning! I must have been so very tired - I didn't quite expect to need <em>that</em> much sleep. Not long after I was up, we had lunch at 11, with one of the best cholents I have ever had. Michal joined us for lunch, so it was 6 of us at the table. I was still waking up during lunch, so I can't remember what happened.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I went back to sleep for 2 hours; and then we had a cosy little Suedat Shelishit of just 4 (Michal and Naamah were gone). After that, it wasn't long until we said Havdalah, and then my very sleepy, sick, but heimische and enjoyable Shabbos was over!</p>
<p>I gave my family the gifts we'd bought in Australia: a little jewellery box in the shape of AU; and a Sydney snowglobe. I tried to arrange going to LOTR:ROTK with Asher, but it was too late and I couldn't get through.</p>
<p>But I didn't just spend the night at home: we went to the movies [Me, Yechiel and Leora], and saw "Under the Tuscan Sun", a crappy romantic flick. At the moment I'm feeling a bit better, but still coughing. Hope I'm up to a week in the desert!</p>
