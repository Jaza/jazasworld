<p>Nimrod tried to wake me up with his usual foot-tickling technique; but since I'd gotten over 10 hours' sleep (I missed the activity on Rabin last night [feeling very sick]), I was awake and ready: I swung my feet off the bed, flat onto the floor, into safety.</p>
<p>We saw the Kinneret for the last time on the bus ride, which was a 2 hour trip to Tel Aviv. Our destination: the Diaspora Museum at one of the universities there.</p>
<p>The museum was a bit interesting: just that it went for over <em>three and a half hours</em>; and the fat American tourguide wouldn't shut up! We saw models of many synagogues, including the biggest one in Warsaw; an ancient Babylonian one; and even a Chinese one.</p>

Last stop before sunrise: site of the Maccabia bridge tragedy. We had a memorial service, and lit some candles; I was very touched, and my eyes were extremely watery. I didn't want to walk on the wooden bridge (which was always there, but was considered "too small" suddenly in 1997), but I did, and I took some photos. We then drove to our overnight stop: Kibbutz Tsuba.</p>
<p>We unpacked, had dinner, etc. - then had a night activity where we discussed minority groups: Druze; Israeli Arabs; and Bedouins.</p>
